    <p align="left">Res. Sir,<br />
        I am writing to you to seek for approval for commencement of the tree planting project that my club members and
        I talked to you about in our last meeting. <br />
        The school’s Environment Club is determined to preserve the environment and make our school beautiful and a good
        space to be in.
        <br /> I humbly request that you look into it as soon as possible because we are almost at the end of the term
        and wouldn’t like to end it without achieving our objective.<br/>
        <br/>I am looking forward to a positive response from you Sir.
    </p>
    <p align="right">Yours sincerely,<br />
        Shyamal Prajapati<br />
